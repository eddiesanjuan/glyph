  "executiveSummary": "Q4 2024 was a strong quarter for the Platform team, with all major OKRs achieved and system reliability exceeding targets. We successfully launched the new authentication service, migrated 85% of services to Kubernetes, and reduced infrastructure costs by 23%. Key challenges included unexpected growth in API traffic (addressed through auto-scaling improvements) and two significant incidents that informed our reliability roadmap for Q1 2025.",
